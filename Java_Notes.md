# Heap Memory vs. Stack Memory in Java

In Java, heap memory and stack memory are two distinct areas where data is stored during program execution. Here's a detailed comparison:

### What is heap memory in Java?

Heap memory is an area of memory used to store objects and their instance variables during the execution of a program.

- **Purpose:**  
  Stores objects and their instance variables.

- **Lifetime:**  
  Objects live as long as they are referenced by other objects or the program. Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory for objects that are no longer in use.

- **Access:**  
  Objects on the heap can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

- **Size:**  
  The heap can dynamically grow as needed, limited by the available system memory.

**Example:**
```java
String name = "John";  // "John" is stored on the heap
```

### What is stack memory in Java?

Stack memory is a region of memory used to store method call information, including parameters, local variables, and return addresses.

- **Purpose:**  
  Stores method parameters, local variables, and method call details.

- **Lifetime:**  
  Data on the stack is created when a method is called and destroyed when the method exits.

- **Access:**  
  Data on the stack is only accessible within the scope of the method it belongs to.

- **Size:**  
  The stack has a fixed size, determined when the thread is created.

**Example:**
```java
public void calculate() {
    int x = 10;   // x is stored on the stack
    int y = 20;   // y is stored on the stack
    int sum = x + y;  // sum is stored on the stack
}
```

### Summary of Differences

| Feature          | Heap Memory                              | Stack Memory                             |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**       | Stores objects and instance variables.   | Stores method parameters, local variables, and call details. |
| **Lifetime**      | Lives as long as referenced. Garbage collection reclaims unused memory. | Data exists during method execution and is destroyed upon exit. |
| **Access**        | Accessible globally.                    | Accessible only within the method's scope. |
| **Size**          | Grows dynamically, limited by system memory. | Fixed size, set when the thread is created. |
